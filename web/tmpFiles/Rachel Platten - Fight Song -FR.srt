1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,300
As a small boat

1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,200
Ocean

1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,000
Sending big waves

1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,100
Moving

1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,100
Like how a single word can make an open heart

1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I could only have a game but I can make an explosion

1
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,100
And all these things I do not say Wrecking balls inside of my brain

1
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,800
I&#39;ll evening their cry Can you hear my voice this time

1
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,200
This is my fight song Take my song of life

1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,200
Prove that I&#39;m the song

1
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,200
Lit my diet from now I&#39;ll be strong

1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,200
I will play my fight song

1
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,900
And I do not really care if nobody else believes

1
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,200
Because I still have a lot of fight in me

1
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,950
Losing friends and I drive away sleep Everyone is worried about me

1
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In too deep Let&#39;s say I&#39;m too deep (too deep)

1
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,950
And it&#39;s been two years I miss my house

1
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,150
But there&#39;s a fire in my bones and I still believe Yeah, I still believe

1
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,950
And all these things I do not say Wrecking balls inside of my brain

1
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,150
I&#39;ll evening their cry Can you hear my voice this time

1
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,150
This is my fight song Take my song of life

1
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,150
Prove that I&#39;m the song

1
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,150
Lit my diet from now I&#39;ll be strong

1
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,150
I will play my fight song

1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,950
Et je ne me soucie pas vraiment si personne ne croit d'autre
Because I still have a lot of fight in me

1
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,350
A lot of fight in me

1
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,900
As a small boat

1
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,100
Ocean

1
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,200
Sending big waves

1
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,800
Moving

1
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,100
Like how a single word can make an open heart

1
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,000
I could only have one game

1
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,000
But I can make a blast

1
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,000
This is my fight song (Hey!) Take my song of life (Hey!)

1
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,500
Prove that I&#39;m the song (Hey!)

1
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,700
Lit my diet from now, I&#39;ll be strong (I&#39;ll be strong)

1
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
I will play my fight song

1
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:15,000
Et je ne me soucie pas vraiment si personne ne croit d'autre
Because I still have a lot of fight in me

1
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20.200
Maintenant, je dois encore beaucoup de combat en moi
